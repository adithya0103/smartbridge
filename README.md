# Car Resale Value Prediction
Car Value Prediction Is Essential for Individuals and Companies 

Each day, thousands of pre-owned cars are sold worldwide. Prediction of the second-hand vehicle price provides an important benchmark to both private buyer and the seller as well as business professionals such as car dealers, lenders and insurance companies.

 Banks need to know the exact value of second-hand vehicles as they are mostly lienholders or they are transferring the loan from one person or another. Insurance companies alike need to be able to assess the value of the pre-owned vehicles, since they will be calculating premiums when they are making their risk assessment.

 The used car market is also a large and strategically important market for car manufacturers since it is closely connected to the new car business. Trading-in used cars in new car retail sales and handling lease returns, repossessions and fleet returns from car rental companies necessitate car manufacturers to engage in the used car market. Therefore, car makers require sophisticated decision support systems to sustain the profitability of the used car business. 

The necessity of prediction paved the way for now well-established companies like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, NADA Blue Book. These companies utilize statistical models on massive databases and they use machine learning algorithms to effectively predict the value of innumerable car brands and models, answering the market demand.
